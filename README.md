This project is part of the Angular Standalone Component FREE Course published on my [blog](https://www.fradev.io/courses/angular/angular-standalone-components-course).

## Getting started

Run `make setup` to install pnpm and then all dependencies.

## Run the Server

Run `make run`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
